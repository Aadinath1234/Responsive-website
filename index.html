        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Modern education in India is often criticised for being based on rote learning rather than problem solving.[163][164] Anil K. Rajvanshi writes that Indian education system seems to be producing zombies since in most of the schools students seemed to be spending majority of their time in preparing for competitive exams rather than learning or playing.[165] Preschool for Child Rights states that almost 99% of pre-schools do not have any curriculum at all.[166] Also creativity is not encouraged or is considered a form of entertainment in most institutions </p>
